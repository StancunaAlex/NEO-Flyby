# NEO-Flyby
## Description
This project analyzes **Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)**, tracking their size, distance from Earth, velocity, and potential risk factors. It uses data from NASA's **CNEOS** (Center for Near-Earth Object Studies) to categorize and score NEOs based on various metrics, such as their **potentially hazardous** status and close approaches. The app also visualizes these metrics to provide insights into the future and past behavior of NEOs.

## Features
- **Data Parsing:** Automatically cleans and processes NEO data from CSV files.
- **Dynamic Categorization:** Classifies NEOs based on various factors like size, distance, and velocity.
- **Risk Scoring:** Calculates and visualizes risk scores based on proximity, speed, and size.
- **Visualization:** Interactive charts displaying categorized data for better understanding.
- **User Input:** Ability to load data for past or future NEOs, or both.

## Technologies
- Python 3.x
- **Pandas** for data processing
- **Streamlit** for front-end UI
- **Matplotlib** for visualizations
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Git/GitHub** for version control
